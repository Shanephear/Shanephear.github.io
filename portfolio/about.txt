The beginning phase of the project was intimidating because I was completely new to Angular and had to deal with a large multi-tenant codebase. The tasks I was given were uncommon in that they required proof of concept and groundwork to perform. These challenges made programming more complex and intriguing for me, and I learned the principles and methods behind numerous concepts as a result of them. I could grasp how the entire UI code works in less than four months and was confident handling crucial duties and complicated modules of the application.
