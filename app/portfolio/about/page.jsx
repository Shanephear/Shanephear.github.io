                <p>Growing up, I always believed that my career would involve sitting in front of a computer since I was
                    so fascinated by the things that it could do. C and C++ during my school days steered me towards
                    programming. Even though I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering as an undergraduate, I
                    was particularly interested in courses that involved programming.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Because of my passion for programming since high school and college, I was persuaded to take a job
                    offer from Infosys Private Limited. I received full stack developer training, which includes Python,
                    SQL, mongo dB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, Express framework, and React JS, and received a high
                    performer tag. The beginning phase of the project was intimidating because I was completely new to
                    Angular and had to deal with a large multi-tenant codebase. The tasks I was given were uncommon in
                    that they required proof of concept and groundwork to perform. These challenges made programming
                    more complex and intriguing for me, and I learned the principles and methods behind numerous
                    concepts as a result of them. I could grasp how the entire UI code works in less than four months
                    and was confident handling crucial duties and complicated modules of the application. With 3 years
                    of work experience as a full stack developer I have built a self-discipline of developing efficient,
                    quality, and reusable code.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Currently I am pursuing my Master&prime;s in Information Technology Management at UTD to develop a strong
                    foundation for my future career and my time at Infosys gave me a fondness for IT.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I would describe myself as follows: If something fascinates me, I will give it my all. I prefer
                    unconventional
                    methods and wind up exploring a lot of concepts in the process, resulting in a beneficial outcome
                    that has
                    always
                    delighted me. Whenever I encounter blank pages, the drive to fill them arises because doing so will
                    be worth
                    every
                    second I put in.</p>
